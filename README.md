# Arcade X
We're rebuilding Miggster and we're building it on top of Arcade X - a base project that we can whitelabel for Miggster and similar sister products. 

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ yarn dev

# build for production and launch server
$ yarn build
$ yarn start

# generate static project
$ yarn generate
```````
